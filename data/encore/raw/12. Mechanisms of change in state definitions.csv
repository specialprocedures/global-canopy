Mechanism causing state change,Description
Diseases,"Harmful pathogens and microbes that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities."
Droughts,Periods in which rainfall falls below the normal range of variation.
Earthquakes,"Earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. They may also cause associated events such as tsunamis, landslides, or even volcanic activity."
Fires,Suppression or increase in fire frequency and/or intensity outside of its natural range of variation.
Flooding,Extreme precipitation events leading to the submergence of dry land.
Landslides,Landslide events leading to geological changes.
Land /freshwater/ seabed area modification,"Major changes in habitat composition and location, for example deforestation."
Ocean acidification,Changes to the ocean chemistry which occurs when carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere and reacts with seawater to produce acid.
Changes in Ocean current and circulation,Large scale movement of waters in the ocean basins.
Pests,"Harmful plants or animals that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities."
Pollutants concentration change,Threats arising from the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment.
Change in species population size,Changes in species populations over time and space.
Change in species composition,Changes in composition of species communities over time and space.
Sea level rise,Increase in global mean sea level as a result of an increase in the volume of water in the world's oceans or heat dilation.
Sea surface temperature,Periods in which sea surface temperatures exceed or go below the normal range of variation.
Storms,Extreme precipitation and/or wind events.
Volcanoes,Volcanic events which may lead to changes in ecosystem components.
Weather conditions,Weather conditions outside of the natural range of variation.
