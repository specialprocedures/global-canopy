A_3_31,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",Fishing and aquaculture,Fishing,,Group,"Fishing can cause disturbances such as noise pollution. It can be a stressor to freshwater and marine life and ecosystems, for instance by impinging on the acoustic habitat of marine mammals. ",Certain types of fishing require occupation of significant water areas and use equipment that contributes to degradation of freshwater and marine ecosystems.,Fishing activities can release greenhouse gases emissions from burning of fossil fuels by fishing vessels and from refrigeration systems.,"Some fishing activities occupy or interact with the seabed (e.g. beam trawling, dredging). This can significantly damage seabed habitats and morphologies such as reef formations.","Fishing activities using boats/ships with combustion engines can release non-GHG emissions into the environment, including CO, NOx, SOx, PM, VOC, and NH3.","Approximately 87% of wild fisheries are exploited unsustainably (fish are removed at rates higher than species' recovery rates), leading to overfishing on a global scale. Entire populations of fish species can collapse due to wild fishing, including non-target species (referred to as bycatch). Additionally, recreational fishing can put pressure on fish populations. Overfishing, excessive catch-and-release practices, and illegal fishing can deplete fish stocks, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and harm the overall biodiversity of rivers, lakes, and oceans.",N/A,"Most fishing activities require use of fishing boats and ships, which can emit toxic pollutants through (1) chemicals used for washing of ships that can affect erosion of estuaries, sediment resuspension, and turbidity, (2) oil and fuel leakage from motors, (3) spillage of antifouling paints.",ND,"Fishing activities can produce solid waste including discarded or lost equipment as well as surplus catch. If improperly disposed of, this can lead to habitat degradation and water pollution.",N/A,"Fishing uses a significant amount of water for a variety of purposes such as transporting fish, cleaning and processing fish, and for cooling equipment.","Invasive species can be brought into a new environment on ships, in fishing equipment or through accidental releases in different ecosystems.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0839

A_2_22,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",Forestry and logging,Logging,,Group,"Logging activities can cause disturbances such as noise pollution,  generating intense noise for periods of days to weeks in a relatively small area. This can disrupt species populations, for example leading some species to temporarily abandon the area.  ",Some logging activities take place in or near freshwater ecosystems. Some logging activities also use purpose-built infrastructure (e.g. roads or waterways) in the freshwater ecosystems.,Logging can release greenhouse gas emissions from the use heavy machinery. Production of charcoal in the forest using tradition methods also releases grenhouse gas emissions.,ND,"Logging can release non-GHG air pollutants from the use heavy machinery, including NOx, N2O, SO2 and CO. These emissions contribute to acidification, eutrophication and photo-oxidant formation.","Logging involves extraction of roundwood and firewood, often in ways and at rates that exceed the capacity of the forest to restore.",N/A,"Logging releases toxic soil and water pollutants due to the use of heavy machinery (e.g. heavy metals such as Pb, Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn). The use of heavy machinery, charcoal production, and saw dust leachate from logging increases the levels of soil and water pollution. Logging of trees can also contribute to increased runoff of mercury from the soils and reduced capacity of the forest to withdraw mercury from air, which can combine to significantly increase mercury concentration in freshwater ecosystems. Logging also releases metal and base cation from the forest soil, increasing the concentration of these elements in waterways and leading to changes to acidity and temperature.",N/A,"Logging generates solid waste. The majority of this waste is damaged residuals, abandoned logs, stumps, tops and branches. If improperly disposed of, this can lead to habitat degradation and air pollution.",Logging activities can transform significant areas and contribute to the degradation of other areas in their proximity (e.g. increased fire risk from exposure of adjacent uncut forests or leftover ground vegetation).,"Logging uses a significant amount of water for transporting logs, cleaning equipment, and fire suppression.","Logging can contribute to spread of invasive forest species by improper timber waste disposal and accidental spread of seeds and plants on machinery or worker's uniforms. Unsuitable logging practices can also weaken native forests, reducing their capacity to control spread of new species.","https://www.sierraforestlegacy.org/FC_FireForestEcology/FFE_LoggingImpacts.php

This can disrupt the existing movement and natural recharge of water from these sources, thereby changing hydrographic characteristics of waterbodies and their extent.","Quarrying of stone, sand and clay can release greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2, water vapour, CFCs and HFCs) from fuel use to achieve high temperatures in processing (2,700F) and from the thermal reaction of calcium carbonate to produce lime and carbon dioxide. Cement manufacture also releases greenhouse gases and micro components (CO and NOx).",Marine quarrying can use large areas of seabed. Sedimentation resulting from seabed use can alter species' compositions and populations in benthic communities.

Resultant vegetation removal and soil excavation modifies terrestrial ecosystems. Aggregate extraction also causes soil erosion and land degradation. ","Quarrying processes require large volumes of water (e.g., to wash aggregates). On average, stone extraction requires 79 litres of water per day per net m3.

A_3_32,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",Fishing and aquaculture,Aquaculture,,Group,Aquaculture operations can cause disturbances like light pollution due to artificial light at night used for surveillance. These can disrupt or negatively affect marine and freshwater species due to the lighting up of the water column from the surface to the seabed. ,"Creation of ponds or reservoirs to enable aquaculture can result in the conversion of freshwater ecosystems into aquaculture farms (e.g. conversion of wetlands, deforestation of mangrove forests) and modification of hydrological patterns on regional ecosystems.","Aquaculture can release greenhouse gas emissions through use of fertilizers, microbial nitrification and denitrification of nitrogenous compounds in the aquatic system. Some aquaculture activities also use on-site energy generators, which release greenhouse gas emissions.",Creation of ponds or reservoirs to enable aquaculture requires use of marine ecosystems including seabeds. Marine aquaculture can affect hydrological features (currents) and sedimentation characteristics resulting in impact further away from the aquaculture activities.,N/A,"It has been estimated that, for each million of shrimp postlarvae farmed, four to seven millions of other organisms are killed by trapping in the nets of farms inlet. Aquaculture has also contributed to fisheries collapse, overfishing and depletion of stock, and species declining. The loss of herbivorous and predatory fish species has reduced total fish biomass and altered the taxonomic composition of the fish community.  ",N/A,"Aquaculture activities often require treatment of soil using lime and other chemicals, which can also leach to other areas within the ecosystem or watershed. Aquaculture also tends to use a wide range of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, including hormones, steroids, antibiotics, and parasiticides to improve productivity, which have been found in surface waters, and groundwaters. These chemicals can cause imbalances in the different ecosystems, including the reduction of water oxygen levels. ","Aquaculture can release substantial quantities of nutrient pollutants into adjacent soils and water bodies (e.g. through nonconsumed aquaculture feed, and, decomposition of dead organisms). Aquaculture production can also cause salt water intrusion into soil, which can exasperate nutrient pollution. For example, soil near some former aquaculture sites was found to be hypersaline, acid and eroded for long periods.","Aquaculture activities generate solid waste. In respect to waste generation, approximately 3 tonnes of freshwater fish can be compared to a community of around 240 inhabitants. While most waste from aquaculture farms is collected by waste collection services, some can be improperly disposed of or used as fertiliser.",Creation of ponds or reservoirs to enable land-based aquaculture can require use of large areas of land. ,"Aquaculture accounts for about 15% of global freshwater use. Water is used in aquaculture for a variety of purposes, including filling and maintaining ponds and tanks, cooling water used in processing, diluting waste products, and washing equipment.","Accidental release of fish into water bodies may result in introduction of invasive species.This leads to displacement of native species, competition for space and food, and spread of pathogens. Aquaculture can also increase the spread of pests that affect farmed fish and are transferred to wild fish. ","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0839

This can disrupt or negatively affect species populations.,"Expansion of irrigated arable crops for private household use can lead to increased habitat modification, in particular through drainage (e.g. of wetlands) and conversion of natural habitats to croplands.","Undifferentiated goods-producing activities of private households such as cultivation of crops can release greenhouse gases emissions (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxides), contributing to air pollution.",N/A,"The cultivation of crops is a notable source of PM10 emissions, primarily during the farming stage due to the extensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as during the land preparation and harvesting stages influenced by the diesel fuel consumption of agricultural machinery.","Household hunting for private use could require fishes and other animals, and making clothes needs fibers such as cotton.","Undifferentiated goods-producing activities of private households for own use may involve extraction of minerals like phosphate, potash, and lime for cultivation and can result in negative impacts on species and habitats.","The cultivation of crops uses pesticides and herbicides such as propanil, quinclorac, sulfonylurea, fipronil, cartap, niclosamide, and formaldehyde which can lead to toxic soil and water pollution.","Households cultivating crops can use fertilizers like nitrogen (N) from ammonium sulfate, phosphorus (P) from rock phosphate, potassium (K) from potassium chloride, and urea from animal manure which can lead to nutrient soil and water pollution.","Undifferentiated goods-producing activities can generate solid waste. The exact form of waste will vary but can include waste generated during the cultivation of crops such as plant residues, packaging materials, harvesting byproducts. This can lead to adverse environmental impacts through habitat degradation and land contamination. ","The area of land occupied for the cultivation of crops varies widely depending on factors such as farming practices, yield potential, and regional conditions, but it can range from a few hectares to several thousand hectares for large-scale commercial production. Expansion of irrigated arable crops has led to increased habitat modification and conversion of natural habitats to croplands.","A significant amount of water is required during the cultivation of crops and other food (including milk, cattle) due to potential water losses through the puddling process, surface evaporation, and percolation. Irrigation of arable crops leads to a substantial water footprint, which may be unsustainable in many areas of the world.","Household activities can unintentionally spread invasive species through farming, landscape management, transport and other activities.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.06.013
