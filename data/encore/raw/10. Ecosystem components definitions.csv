Ecosystem components,Description
Atmosphere,The atmosphere is the mass of air surrounding the earth. Its components (such as oxygen) and its processes (such as temperature regulation) support a number of essential ecosystem services.
Structural and Biotic Integrity,"Structural and biotic integrity relates to the extent to which the physical structure and composition of an ecosystem falls within its natural range of variation. These structural characteristics, such as canopy height and vegetation density, underpin many of the services provided by ecosystems."
Land geomorphology,"Land geomorphology describes the structure of the land, such as mountains and valleys. Land geomorphology supports the provision of some regulatory ecosystem services, like erosion control."
Minerals,Minerals are naturally occurring compounds not produced by living beings. They can be metallic or non-metallic and play an important supporting role in the provision of services like soil quality regulation.
Ocean geomorphology,"Ocean geomorphology describes the structure of the marine environment such as shelfs and slopes. Ocean geomorphology supports the provision of some regulatory ecosystem services, like dilution by ecosystems."
Soils and sediments,"Soils and sediments are the layers of the earth's surface that support life. They comprise top-soil, sub-soil and ocean sediments and support a number of regulatory ecosystem services."
Species,"Species include plants, animals, fungi, algae and genetic resources, which can be wild or domestic/commercial, for example livestock. Species underpin a wide range of ecosystem services."
Water,"Water includes surface water, ground water, ocean water, fossil water and soil water. Water is essential for a wide range of ecosystem services."
