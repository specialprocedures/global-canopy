1,Water supply ecosystem service,"The SEEA EA definition of the water supply ecosystem service states that the service ""reflects the combined ecosystem contributions of water flow regulation, water purification, and other ecosystem services to the supply of water of appropriate quality to users for various uses including household consumption"" (SEEA EA, 2021). 
When interpreting the dependency data and ratings from this database, we encourage users to consider that water supply represents a final ecosystem service that combines other water-related ecosystem services also captured in the database. As these ecosystem services are designed to overlap in the SEEA EA categorisation, users should consider excluding the water supply ecosystem service from their analyses where this may cause duplication.
When describing an economic activity's dependency on the water supply ecosystem service, we encourage users to refer to ecosystems as ""providing the ecosystem service of regulating water quantity"" or ""providing the water quantity regulation ecosystem service"". The wording ""water provision"" or ""ecosystems supply water"" are occasionally used as a shorthand but these statements are not scientifically correct and could be misleading. Ecosystems do not generate, produce, provide water, they support the regulation of quality and quantity of water throughout the water cycle."
2,"Dependency on water supply, water purification and water flow regulation ecosystem services","In this database, an economic activity is described as dependent on the water supply, water purification and water flow regulation ecosystem services both if the activity extracts water from the ecosystem itself and if the activity uses piped water. Scientific and grey literature reviewed for the purposes of determining the dependency links (see Tab 3) do not always differentiate between an economic activity's consumption of water that it directly extracted and that has been supplied to it. The data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output (EE-MRIO) database that was used to calculate the dependency materiality ratings for water-related ecosystem services (see Tab 6) also does not differentiate between water that has been directly extracted by the economic activity and water that has been supplied to it."
