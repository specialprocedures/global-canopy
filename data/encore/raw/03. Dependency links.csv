A_3_32,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",Fishing and aquaculture,Aquaculture,,Group,N/A,"Aquaculture is dependent on the ecosystem contributions' to the growth of animals and plants (e.g. fish, shellfish, seaweed) in aquaculture facilities that are harvested for various uses. Aquaculture also requires plant and animal-based materials for feedstock to support the development of fish and other products. Natural fiber-based materials are also used, for example ropes.","Aquaculture depends on solid waste remediation by ecosystems (e.g. micro-organisms, algae, plants and animals) to break down water contaminants as well as waste and leachates from the production.",Aquaculture relies on soil and sediment retention for protection of the areas where aquaculture farms are located as well as for retention of the sediment and water qualities necessary for aquaculture production. ,Aquaculture depends on water purification by ecosystems to provide clean and safe conditions to rear fish and other products and to minimise the impacts resulting from wastes generated from fish farms.,Aquaculture is dependent on the maintenance of soil quality in order to maintain net productivity. ,"Aquaculture is dependent on bio-physico chemical processes to dilute, breakdown, and lessen the potential negative impacts of pollutants and other compounds in the natural environment, and those resulting from aquacultural production, in order to provide clean and safe conditions to rear fish and other products, and to minimise the impacts resulting from wastes generated from fish and other species farms.","Aquaculture depends on biological control to reduce disesases exacerbated due to often high concentrations of fish, through the use of bacteria and bacteriophages as biological agents for disease control. Most disease in aquaculture is as a result of stress caused by poor husbandry practices. This can be ameliorated through increased water quality for example, and disease control could help reduce the disease symptoms. ","The filtering of pollutants and its mitigation effects in the air contribute to good conditions for healthy fish populations. Aquaculture can also generate air pollution, for example from wastes generated from fish farms, depending on air filtration by ecosystems to mitigate or reduce the harmful impacts of the activity in order to provide clean and safe conditions to rear fish and other products.","Both marine and freshwater aquaculture is susceptible to flood damage.
