# ENCORE's Knowledge Base Outlining Business Impacts and Dependencies on Biodiversity

**Version:** October 2024

---

## About
This zip folder contains the updated ENCORE knowledge base and has been developed as part of the Horizon Europe project **“Strengthening Understanding and Strategies of Business to Assess and Integrate Nature (SUSTAIN)”**, to improve and update the knowledge base on business dependencies and impacts on nature. 

The organizations involved in the technical developments and quality assurance of the data were:
- **UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)**
- **Capitals Coalition**
- **Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL)**
- **International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)**
- **IUCN Europe**
- **Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich)**

Other SUSTAIN project partners include:
- Oxford Sustainable Finance Group
- WBCSD
- ShareAction
- Fundación Biodiversidad

The enhanced knowledge base is aimed primarily at businesses, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies to support their screening of potential dependencies and impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

### Key Features:
- **Updated Content**: Based on the latest scientific research and grey literature.
- **Structured Knowledge Base**:
  - Links economic activities (categorized by ISIC) to ecosystem services and pressures.
  - Includes materiality ratings (Very Low to Very High).
  - Highlights upstream and downstream value chain links for each activity.
  - Connects ecosystem services to ecosystem types and components.

The ENCORE tool was first launched in 2018 by the **ENCORE Partners (Global Canopy, UNEP FI, and UNEP-WCMC)**.

## Overview
The knowledge base comprises 18 files:

1. **Cover Page**: Overview of the spreadsheet and information about the project and authors.
2. **Ecosystem Services Definitions**: Table of ecosystem services and their definitions, per SEEA-EA.
3. **Dependency Links**: Links between economic activities and ecosystem services they depend on.
4. **Pressures Definitions**: Definitions of pressure categories, based on the Natural Capital Protocol.
5. **Pressure Links**: Links between economic activities and the pressures they might cause.
6. **Dependency Materiality Ratings**
7. **Pressure Materiality Ratings**
8. **Dependency Materiality Detail**: Component scores of dependency materiality ratings.
9. **Pressure Materiality Detail**: Component scores of pressure materiality ratings.
10. **Ecosystem Components Definitions**
11. **Links Between Ecosystem Services and Ecosystem Types With Components**
12. **Mechanisms of Change in State Definitions**
13. **Links Between Pressures, Mechanisms of Change in State, and Ecosystem Types With Components**
14. **EXIOBASE-NACE-ISIC Crosswalk**: Developed for value chain links, based on EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (2019) and Stadler et al. (2019).
15. **Note on Value Chain Links**
16. **Upstream Value Chain Links**: Key upstream sectors/economic activities linked to each ENCORE activity.
17. **Downstream Value Chain Links**: Key downstream sectors/economic activities linked to each ENCORE activity.
18. **Explanatory Notes**
